Hello and welcome to PacMERN!

PacMERN relies on a express server backend connected to MongoDB and a vite powered React frontend.

To succesfully setup the project you will need to follow these steps:

1. Read and follow the instructions of the README.md found in '/Backend' and '/PacMERN-frontend'.
2. When setup is complete, in a new terminal cd to '/Backend' and run the server with 'npm run dev'
3. In a seperate new terminal, cd to '/PacMERN-frontend' and run the front-end with 'npm run dev'.
